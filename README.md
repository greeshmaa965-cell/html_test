# HTML Practice Repository

This repository contains my HTML practice files.
I created separate files to understand each HTML tag clearly.

## Topics Covered
- Basic HTML structure
- Headings and paragraphs
- Text formatting tags
- Links and navigation
- Images and iframes
- Tables (caption, colspan)
- Forms (input, label, date)
- Semantic tags (header, footer, article, aside)

This is my first GitHub repository and marks the start of my
web development journey.
